* Cleanup test application
* improve `inline` support and usage.

? Use statically allocated values in ctpl_parser_parse_token_expr()
? Add support for string literals in expressions (started in string-literals
  branch)
? Use GIO (there is GMemory*Stream) as I/O layer instead of libmb?
  Advantages would be to drop the libmb dependence, while using a well-used
  I/O layer.
  Disadvantages may be the speed and built-in functionalities we need.
  Writing(?) a small library (or module) to extend GIO would probably be enough
  for the latter.
